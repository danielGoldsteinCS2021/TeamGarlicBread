Table and Test Plan

### Test Plan
Our team organized the documentation of the test cases by dividing up the test cases evenly amongst all four members. Individually we wrote the natural language test cases we were assigned into our own markdown files. We each created our own local branch, and pushed our markdown file into the team repository. Everyone reviewed the individual group members' pull request for their markdown file by providing feedback and approval, and once it was finalized the branches were merged with the master branch.

The chosen testing framework provides an organized set of steps in natural language to instruct a programmer on how to code the needed test cases for the frontend. Once the developer decides to create the test cases, they will be able to run them against the CICD pipeline set up via github actions. Whenever code is pushed, the pipeline will automatically run the created tests against the updated code base. 

Our team will create a folder for each specification to organize the different test case files. All of these folders will then be placed in a parent folder that contains all the test cases. This will be done in case there is a need for a test case that doesn't fit within any of the already defined specifications.
